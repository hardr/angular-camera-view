# Angular Camera View

In this assignment, you will use Angular built-in directives and filters as well as create your own filters to build a simple shopping page for cameras.

## Example in action

## Example Data

Here is the data that will be used. It is included in the `ng-init` directive for you.

```javascript
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Nikon D3100 DSLR',
    image: 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/713u2gDQqML._SX522_.jpg',
    rating: 4,
    price: 369.99,
    onSale: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Canon EOS 70D',
    image: 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81U00AkAUWL._SX522_.jpg',
    rating: 2,
    price: 1099.0,
    onSale: false
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'Nikon D810A',
    image:'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91wtXIfLl2L._SX522_.jpg',
    rating: 3,
    price: 3796.95,
    onSale: true
  }
]
```

## Part 1 - Requirements

The camera shop page will require the following:

<!-- 1. Display of the data in some format. -->
<!-- 1. The price is formatted into a currency -->
<!-- 1. The words "On SALE!" (or some form) are used when `onSale` is true -->
<!-- 1. The ability to sort by name or rating (default is name) -->
<!-- 1. The ability to search to filter the results (keeping the same order). -->
<!-- 1. A custom filter to handle the conversion of the rating from a number to asterisks. It is assumed that the rating will be an integer. -->

## Part 2 - Requirements

The goal of part 2 is to add controllers to the exercise implementing a cart functionality.

<!-- 1. Create two controllers, one to manage the cart, and one to manage the catalog of items. -->
<!-- 1. Remove all instances of `ng-init` and initialize any data into the controller. Ensure all `ng-model` variables are managed in a controller. -->
<!-- 1. When the user clicks "Add to Cart", the cart manages the item inserted. Subsequent adds increase the quantity of the item. -->
<!-- 1. User can remove an item from the cart by clicking on a button (it will remove the entire quantity of that item). -->
<!-- 1. The subtotal, tax, and total are calculated in place. -->
